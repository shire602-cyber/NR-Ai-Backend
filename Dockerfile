# RAILWAY_GIT_COMMIT_SHA is injected by Railway and is different on every
# deploy. We declare it as a build ARG at the very top so every subsequent
# layer sees it in its cache key — any source change produces a new SHA
# and invalidates the whole build. Without this, Railway was happily
# reusing a stale "cached" builder stage forever.

# Source layer — tagged with the commit SHA so Railway's cache key
# changes every deploy. We embed the SHA in TWO places to defeat
# layer reuse: a label (which is part of the image manifest) and
# a file that the build step reads. Without this Railway was
# reusing the entire builder stage between deploys of the same
# branch, which is why the dist/ produced was sometimes stale.
