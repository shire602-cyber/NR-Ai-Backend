# Audit Findings

Use this file as the human-readable backlog. Keep one row per finding until it is moved into the issue tracker.

| ID | Severity | Area | Repo | Environment | Role | Finding | Repro Steps | Expected | Actual | Owner | Fix Wave | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AUD-001 | P1 | API coverage | NR-Ai-Backend | local | customer / firm staff | Static API coverage found frontend calls that did not map cleanly to mounted backend routes. | Run `npm run audit:api-coverage:strict`. | Every frontend API reference maps to a mounted backend route or is explicitly parked. | Fixed in branch: strict API coverage now passes with 0 unresolved refs. | TBD | Wave 2 | Fixed |
| AUD-002 | P2 | Performance | NR-Ai-Backend | local | all roles | Production build emits large client chunk warnings. | Run `npm run build`. | Route-level bundles stay below the configured warning threshold or have documented lazy-load exceptions. | Partially mitigated: Vite now separates large vendor families, ExcelJS is lazy-loaded from export/import actions, and `index.html` does not preload the spreadsheet chunk; oversized on-demand spreadsheet/PDF chunks remain documented exceptions. | TBD | Wave 3 | Partially fixed |
| AUD-003 | P3 | Build hygiene | NR-Ai-Backend | local | engineering | Production build emits a PostCSS `from` option warning. | Run `npm run build`. | Build output is free of avoidable toolchain warnings. | Root cause traced to Tailwind 3 internals calling `postcss.parse` without `from`; keep tracked until the Tailwind/PostCSS toolchain is upgraded. | TBD | Wave 3 | Open |
| AUD-004 | P2 | Lint gate | NR-Ai-Backend | local | engineering | `npm run lint` failed on Node audit scripts because ESLint treated `.mjs` scripts as browser globals. | Run `npm run lint`. | Lint exits 0 so CI can use it as a reliable gate. | Fixed in branch: Node globals are configured for scripts/config files. Remaining output is warning-only. | TBD | Wave 3 | Fixed |
| AUD-005 | P3 | Code hygiene | NR-Ai-Backend | local | engineering | Lint reports a large warning backlog. | Run `npm run lint`. | Warning backlog is triaged and reduced over time without blocking release gates. | 512 warnings remain, mostly unused imports, React Compiler guidance, and minor prefer-const/no-useless-escape cleanup. | TBD | Wave 3 | Open |

## Fix Waves

- Wave 1: P0/P1 security, login, onboarding, deploy, firm workflows.
- Wave 2: API mismatch, validation, audit logs, data integrity.
- Wave 3: UX polish, performance, observability, documentation.
- Wave 4: parked/backend-only module triage.
